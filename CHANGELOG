  o Do not list the backends in the __init__'s __all__ to allow not
    supporting couch on the client side until the code is diveded into
    client and server.  o Fix bad dependencies in setup.py.
  o Fix broken pip install
  o Database request have default timeout too high, a
    soledad.SOLEDAD_TIMEOUT variable has been added in order to have

  o Add validation and authorization of actions upon interaction with
    server.
  o Add MAC authentication to encrypted representation of documents.
  o Add SQLCipher API to SQLCipher backend (allow for use of raw keys,
    add better encrypted db assertion, add cipher, kdf_iter,
    cipher_page_size and rekey PRAGMAS).
  o Change symmetric encryption method to AES-256 CTR mode.
  o Change the local storage of the storage secret:
      * Use scrypt to derive a key for the encryption of the storage
        secret.
      * Store secret in a file called 'soledad.json' by default.
      * Also store the salt and encryption details, as defined in the
        spec.
      * This change is not backwards compatible (i.e. all previously
        stored secrets are incompatible with this new encryption and
        storage scheme).
  o Improve tests coverage.
  o Split soledad client and server into two different packages.
  o Use scrypt to derive the key for local encryption.

Server:
  o Add a `status` option to Soledad init script.
  o Allow to initialize soledad with a blank server
  o b64 encode all U1DB data in couch backend to avoid utf8 encoding
    problems.
    * init.d script improvements:
    * Add LSB (Linux Standards Base) 3.1 compliant header
    * Remove unnecessary backslashes in variable definitions
    * Replace environment variables with more standard upper-cased names
    * Make a TWISTD_PATH environment variable to replace hard-coded
      /usr/local/bin/twistd
    * Pull environment variables together into one block o Remove strict
      dependency on leap.common.
